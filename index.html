<h2>Seerah of Best of Creation ﷺ</h2>
<h3>Why One Should Learn About the Seerah of the Prophet ﷺ </h3>
‏<p>Prophet ﷺ said: </p>
<b>يُؤْمِنُ أَحَدُكُمْ حَتَّى أَكُونَ أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ وَلَدِهِ وَوَالِدِهِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ </b>
<i>'None of you truly believes until I'm more beloved to him than his child, his father and all the people'</i>
<p>In Arabic the word حُب (hubb) means love but it also has a root-meaning; seed. And as the seed is nurtured, the same way love is nurtured by the knowledge of the beloved The more you know the beloved, the more you love the beloved. Henceforth, to love the Prophet ﷺ we need to learn about Him. [27:10 - 27:50]</p>
